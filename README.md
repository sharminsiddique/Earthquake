A repo focusing on some exploratory data analysis, using Matplotlib, Numpy and Pandas. 

Some of the questions I aimed to answer: 
- Where did earthquakes generally occcur within the last 30 days?
- The magnitude of those earthquakes that occured within the last 30 days.
- What was the spread of the magnitudes of the earthquakes that had occurred?
- Where do higher magnitude earthquakes occur?
- What was the relationship between the depth and magnitude of earthqakes? 

The following Kaggle was used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farazrahman/earthquake?taskId=6195
  
This was one of the first projects added to my portfolio, and knowing the knowledge I know now I see plenty of improvements I could make. 
However, this is an ideal way of measuring my own progress to see how my own skills have improved in Matplotlib, Numpy and Pandas and how much more I have learnt.
